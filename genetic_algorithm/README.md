This program had as an objective the analysis of the genetic algorithm.

The following base line parameters were used:
  • crossover probability = 70%
  • mutation probability = 0,1%
  • tournament size = 5% of the size of a population
  • population size = 100
  • number of iterations = 1000
  • starting number of active objects = 100
  
In the following runs the probability of mutation, probability of crossover, tournament size and population size were changed one at a time to evaluate the impact of each parameter in the evolution of the algorithm.
